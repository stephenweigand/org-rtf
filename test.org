* Markup

From the manual: "You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =verbatim= and
~code~, and, if you must, ‘+strike-through+’. Text in the code and
verbatim string is not processed for Org mode specific syntax, it is
exported verbatim."


Export this with ~C-x C-e~ after putting point at the end of the following line.

#+BEGIN_SRC
