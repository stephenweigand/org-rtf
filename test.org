* Markup

From the manual: "You can make words *bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, =verbatim= and
~code~, and, if you must, +strike-through+. Text in the code and
verbatim string is not processed for Org mode specific syntax, it is
exported verbatim." Also we can use x^ and x_2. 

Greek symbols like \beta are not yet implemented.

Export this with ~C-x C-e~ after putting point at the end of the following line.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-rtf-export-as-rtf)
#+END_SRC
