;; ox-rtf.el --- Probably not an RTF Back-End for Org Export Engine -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Stephen Weigand <weigand dot stephen at gmail dot com>

;;
;; Initially borrowing from John Kitchin's Scimax `ox-rtf.el' at
;;
;;    https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax/blob/master/ox-rtf.el
;;
;; Currently trying to emulate `ox-ascii.el' and `ox-html.el' and
;; friends in terms of doc strings function arguments, etc.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library implements an RTF back-end for Org generic exporter.
;; See Org manual for more information.
