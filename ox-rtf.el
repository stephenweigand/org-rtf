;;; ox-rtf.el --- Probably not an RTF Back-End for Org Export Engine -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Stephen Weigand <weigand dot stephen at gmail dot com>

;;
;; Initially borrowing from John Kitchin's Scimax `ox-rtf.el' at
;;
;;    https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax/blob/master/ox-rtf.el
;;
;; Currently trying to emulate `ox-ascii.el' and `ox-html.el' and
;; friends in terms of doc strings function arguments, etc.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library implements an RTF back-end for Org generic exporter.
;; See Org manual for more information.

;;; Code:

;;; Dependencies (SDW is not sure which are needed)
(require 'ox)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'format-spec)

If narrowing is active in the current buffer, only export its

If a region is active, export that region.

A non-nil optional argument ASYNC means the process should happen
asynchronously.  The resulting buffer should be accessible
through the `org-export-stack' interface.

When optional argument SUBTREEP is non-nil, export the sub-tree
at point, extracting information from the headline properties
first.

When optional argument VISIBLE-ONLY is non-nil, don't export
contents of hidden elements.

When optional argument BODY-ONLY is non-nil, strip title and
table of contents from output.

EXT-PLIST, when provided, is a property list with external
parameters overriding Org default settings, but still inferior to
file-local settings.

Export is done in a buffer named \"*Org RTF Export*\", which
